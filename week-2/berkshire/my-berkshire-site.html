<!-- Reflection

- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    - It was great! I learned about a new HTML5 element called <article> which is like a div but has more semantic meaning, so we incorporated that into the page.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    - Thanks to Jon Duckett's book on HTML/CSS, I read about improvements from HTML 4 to HTML5 that help better describe an HTML document. I found the improvements to be helpful, making the document much easier to read and organize.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    - It was a bit hard to not focus on the formatting since that's the first thing you see and want to change when working with HTML, but I wanted to make sure I had the basic tags down before worrying about formatting; that'll come later.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    - Well there's no escaping learning HTML since it's the only language that renders pages on the web. I'd say formatting is the hardest part about HTML.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    - It really just comes from practice. My partner and I used JSFiddle to work on the HTML which worked well because we were able to instantly see the output.
