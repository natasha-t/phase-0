// Person 1 - Tests to User Stories

// As a user, I want to use three functions to determine the sum, mean, and median of the numbers from 2 lists, 
// one of odd length and the other of even length. The three functions are:
// 1) sum
    // - If I put in a list of numbers of odd length into the sum function, I will get the sum of all the values from that list.
    // The same result will happen if I pass in a list of numbers of even length into the sum function.
// 2) mean
    // - If I pass in the odd length #'s list into the mean function, I will get the average of those numbers. 
    // Same result will happen if I pass the even length #'s list.
// 3) median
    // - If I pass in the odd length #'s list into the median function, I will get the median value of those numbers. 
    // Same result will occur if I pass the even length #'s list.
