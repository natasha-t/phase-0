<!--
What is jQuery?
  jQuery is a library that includes functions that manipulation DOM elements
What does jQuery do for you?
  jQuery can make an HTML page dynamic and interactive by using functions like on click, mouse over, and hover (to name a few) that change targeted HTML elements.
What did you learn about the DOM while working on this challenge?
  I learned that individual HTML tags and id's/classes can be targeted and jQuery functions can be appended to them to make the HTML page interactive.
